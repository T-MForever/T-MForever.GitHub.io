  <p>
    We met in August of 2017 - Tyler's freshman and Madelein's senior years at NAU. <br>
    At the time Tyler was joining the Triathlon Team, of which Madelein was the President. <br>
    <br>
    
    Over the course of a few weeks we became friends and got to know each other better. <br>
    We had our first date in Las Vegas during the "Team Night Out" of the Triathlon Team's annual <br>
    training camp at Lake Mead, about 30 minutes south of the Strip. <br><br><br>

    After that year we continued to date, although it was long distance, we made it work - because <br>
    somethings are just meant to last. <br><br>

    Throughout that period of time we got closer, began to love one another and became eachother's best <br>
    friends. After Tyler graduated and moved back home we knew we could really begin to start planning a <br>
    future together. 

    On July 10th, 2022 we got engaged on our favorite beach in our favorite town - Laguna Beach. <br><br><br>
