    It all started in the mountains... <br><br><br>
    <!--insert pic of nau mountians here...-->

    We met in August of 2017, at the first run workout of the year for the NAU Traithlon Team.<br>
    Our next interaction was at the first team swim practice, where although Tyler could swim, <br>
    we quickly found out he did not swim well. Madelein would spend time teaching him <br>
    how and at times laughing at his stupid jokes (or maybe she was just laughing at his form). <br>
    <br>
    Fast forward a month or so, and it was time for the team's first training camp in Lake Mead, Nevada. <br>
    As fate would have it we ended up in the same car for the trip, and over the next four hours we would talk <br>
    about everything under the sun - we had so much in common that it felt like we had been best friends our whole <br>
    lives... to this day niether of us can remember a silent moment that entire trip. <br>
    Team tradition was to head to the Vegas Strip on the last night of the camp for some fun, however Tyler had managed <br>
    to convince Madelein to go to dinner with him. And so it began... our first date, October 1st 2017. <br>
    <!--Insert first date pic here-->
    <br>
    <br>

    Since then we have grown together, supporting one another through all of our various schoolings, being there <br>
    for eachother through the ups and downs of being a young adult, and have only become closer, even better friends, <br>
    and falling more in love with eachother each and every day. <br><br>

    As we end our chapter that started in the mountains, <br>we start our new chapter at the beach, surrounded by the people we <br>
    love most.
